# Squirrel Server

Squirrel server is an exploration activity aimed at students interested in learning Linux, cryptography, and cybersecurity. It requires them to learn a little bit of scripting/programming along the way. It has been designed to be modular and allow the admin to switch out challenges as they see fit. Squirrel is in its infancy right now and is fragile and extremely insecure! Do not run this on a public facing server.
